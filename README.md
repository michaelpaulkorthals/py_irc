Python infrared remote control utilities for Raspberry Pi

In the home theater, the devices (e.g. Bluray player, projector, monitor, amplifier, lighting, etc.) are usually controlled with infrared remote controls. The problem is that the operation of these devices is completely different and separated. Each device is controlled with its own remote control. This turns the home theater into an uncomfortable, complex technical workplace until the movie is shown.

In order to optimize this situation, it is desirable to combine the individual operating procedures at the push of a button. e.g .:
 * Play the movie with the projector on the screen in a quiet sound mix
   * Configure the 4x4 4K HDMI Matrix to connect the devices:
     * Input: 4K Bluray Player
     * Output: 4K HDMI to analog 7.1 extractor
     * Output: Projector
   * Turn on the 4K projector
   * Turn on the 4K Bluray Player
   * Enable 4K HDMI to analog 7.1 extractor
   * Switch on dynamic compressor for channels FL, FR, CENTER, SUBW
   * Switch on dynamic compressor for channels SL, SR, RL, RR
   * Switch 7 speakers and a subwoofer line-out to the analog amplifier
   * Switch on analog amplifier 7.1
   * Adjust the sound volume accordingly depending on the time of day
   * Switch the subwoofer off
   * Open the Bluray Player drive

This requires to build up and LAMP Server on Raspberry Pi Zero W to provide the website with that and other buttons on your mobile phone or tablet. 
The Raspberry Pi Zero W must be extended by IR Receiver and Transmitter circuits and a 5 V power supply. 

The complete device could look like this:
